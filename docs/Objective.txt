Objective: Build a production-ready AI-powered mock interview system that conducts intelligent technical interviews
Your Mission
Design and implement a full-stack system that acts as an intelligent interview coach, conducting mock technical interviews based on candidate profiles and job requirements.

Technical Stack:
- Frontend: Modern React application with TypeScript for interactive user experience
- Backend: Python-based multi-agent system with RESTful API
- AI Integration: SiliconFlow API for all large language model operations
- Real-time Communication: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for live interview sessions

The system should provide an intuitive web interface where users can upload resumes, input job descriptions, and engage in realistic mock interviews with AI-powered feedback and evaluation.
